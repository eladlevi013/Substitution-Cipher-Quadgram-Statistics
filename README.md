# Substitution-Cipher-quadgram-statistics
The algorithm keeps searching for a better key, and we do that by scoring the decrypted text(always with a different key).
We are scoring the decrypted text, by computing the probability of a piece of text being english(by multiplying the quadgram probabilities).

# Demonstration of the program:
